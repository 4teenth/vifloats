1. git clone https://github.com/4teenth/vifloats.git

2. open root folder of this repository

3. make a new branch and switch to via git checkout -b yourbranchname

4. DON'T change/push anything to MAIN branch, write the code in YOUR branch

5. if needed take the latest version with new features from dev branch via git checkout -(previous or branch name), then run git pull and go back to your branch again

6. when you will be ready (add, commit) push changes to your branch and create a pull request if needed

Pay attention you first time clone a repository you will get all changes from MAIN branch. MAIN is a stable branch and updates rarely. The latest changes and experimental features live in dev branch, it updates regularly.
So, for better experience make sure you have up-to-date branch.
